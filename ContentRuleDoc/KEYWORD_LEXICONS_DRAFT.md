## OVERLAP ANALYSIS

Some keywords appear in multiple lexicons:

| Keyword | Adultery | Drunkenness | Sedition |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| hidden | X | | X |
| secret | X | | X |
| shadow | X | | X |
| under | X | | X |

**Recommendation:** Allow overlap. When a phrase matches multiple lexicons, it can receive up to 2 tags (per the max 2 tags rule). This creates thematic bridges between Nations.

---

## USAGE RULES

1. **Match Method:** Case-insensitive exact match
2. **Match Location:** Either word1 OR word2
3. **Tag Assignment:** If match found → tag = 1
4. **Multiple Matches:** Max 2 tags per phrase
5. **No Partial Match:** "hidden" does not match "hide"

---

## AWAITING APPROVAL

Please review:
1. Are these keywords appropriate for the game's tone?
2. Should any keywords be removed?
3. Should any keywords be added?
4. Is the overlap handling correct?

Once approved, these will be integrated into ContentRuleDoc.md Section 6.3.
