## RULE ZERO: The Compound Word Gate

**Before anything else, every phrase must pass this test:**

### The Google/Dictionary Test
1. Search the phrase as one word (e.g., "popcorn")
2. If it appears ONLY as one word → **INVALID, STOP HERE**
3. If BOTH forms exist with similar frequency → **VALID** (see Borderline Policy)
4. If predominantly written as two words → **VALID**

### Borderline Compound Policy
Some phrases exist in both compound and two-word forms (e.g., "firetruck" / "fire truck").

**ALLOWED if:** The two-word version is used as frequently as the compound version.

| Status | Examples | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| ✅ ALLOWED | fire truck, ball game, game day, show room, door frame | Both forms commonly used |
| ❌ INVALID | popcorn, bedroom, doorbell, sunlight | One-word form dominant (>90%) |

**Quick Test:** If you'd write it either way without thinking twice, it's allowed.

### Quick Reference: NEVER Split These
| Invalid (One Word) | What It Looks Like Split |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| popcorn | pop corn |
| corndog | corn dog |
| cupcake | cup cake |
| pancake | pan cake |
| bedroom | bed room |
| bathroom | bath room |
| cardboard | card board |
| catfish | cat fish |
| goldfish | gold fish |
| starfish | star fish |
| backyard | back yard |
| keyboard | key board |
| bookcase | book case |
| breakfast | break fast |
| sunlight | sun light |
| daylight | day light |
| moonlight | moon light |
| starlight | star light |

### Valid Two-Word Phrases (Examples)
| Valid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| ice cream | Never written "icecream" |
| hot dog | Never written "hotdog" |
| peanut butter | Never written "peanutbutter" |
| apple pie | Never written "applepie" |
| front door | Never written "frontdoor" |
| high school | Never written "highschool" |
| seat belt | Never written "seatbelt" |
