When to Use Gemini CLI
Use gemini -p when:
	⁃	﻿﻿Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
	⁃	﻿﻿Comparing multiple large files
	⁃	﻿﻿Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
	⁃	﻿﻿Current context window is insufficient for the task
	⁃	﻿﻿Working with files totaling more than 100KB
	⁃	﻿﻿Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
	⁃	﻿﻿Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase
Important Notes
- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for -yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When
checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get
accurate results
