One-Liner  
An upbeat word puzzle game that tests players' ability to solve more complex  
word puzzles and  level-based challenges  
  
What it is:  
  
A timed word puzzle game with a progressive narrative unveiled through gameplay where players solve increasingly complex word puzzles, using power boosts to reduce the effect of obstacles and upgrades keep up with level-based challenges.  
  
### The puzzle:  
There is one starter word and under it, there are 12 subsequent base words placed below it with 3 additional bonus words below that to earn one by one— each bonus word awarded on the basis of gameplay momentum at the moment of reaching the 12th word and continuity of momentum until momentum is lost or all 3 bonus words are solved—and all these words exist within a upward scrolling window at the center of the screen that displays up to 4 to 5 words at a time with the current word being second from the bottom (unless you have reached the final word for the round). The starter word is always visible at the start of the level while the words after it only have the first letter visible and indented squared spaces: the number of them representing each missing letter to complete the word. The current square displays a slow pulsing glow that serves as a cursor/carat to be filled in with a wood grain box, each engraved with the letter that fills the space. The every word after the starter word makes a weird pair with the word before it.   
Example: car (starter word)> door, Door> stop, stop>sign, Sign > up, (and so on for a total of 12-15 possible word pairs made from a total possible 16 words per level)  
  
These words must make lexical sense based on common American language as two word (in the correct order) phrases for each pair, not just words that are associated.  
  
In addition to the puzzle as is, there are obstacles that drop down within the window and cause issues like:  
-ice: a snowflake floats down, landing on any unsolved target word, causing all its spaces to freeze over, meaning this word is unavailable to solve for 3 turns, not including solving for this word—at which point, the ice quickly breaks and dissolves, allowing the player to solve that word.  
-padlock: falls and places a lock on each letter of the target word it lands on which makes this word unavailable unless the word after it is solved.  
-charcoal: slowly descends in a flame to land on the last letter of the target word, revealing that letter, but leaving a smoke screen that covers the first letter and all the middle letters. The smoke will rise slowly, and for every word the smoke covers, the window collapses that word, bringing down the others, and decreasing earned points by the value of that word until all words above it are gone. Then the current word collapses, disappearing, and ending the effect of that obstacle.  
-acid: a green drop comes from the top of the screen and lands on the target word, causing it to bubble. It has the same effect as the charcoal, but in the opposite direction, leading downward. Becomes salt as a secondary obstacle if you use a power boost, which fills effected words with salt until that word is unsolvable due to the salt. (It is a slower process than acid but it continues to trickle down the window as the window scrolls up, passing salt to the next blank spaces).  
-flood: a drain valve drops and lands in a weird and a pool of water comes up from the bottom of the window and once it gets to the target word, the water fills each space one by one in random order. Once all the letter spaces are filled, the word is flooded and cannot be solved. The water will recede but those spaces will remain filled for the duration of the level.  
-acorn: an acorn drops from the top and grows a tree from the bottom slowly. One of its branches will cover a word. Any space that the branch occupies will not be available. The player may only fill in the available spots for partial points (this tree does not scroll as the words scroll, which means, a word will be covered, but it’s possible you have solved for it already). This tree will continue to grow branches throughout the level  
-magnet: a yellow magnet falls and stops beside the word above the subject word. If you get it correct, it stays with that word, changing color from yellow to orange—if not, it pulls the word above the word above, erasing it and disperses, you’ll have to go back and fix it. If you get it right after orange, it turns from orange to red—if not, it will pull the three words above the subject weird, erasing them, you’ll have to go back and fix it. If you get it correct again when it’s red, it disappears, if not, you have to redo the entire board.  
-Sand: fills one random word space from 1-5 random words slowly which could make the word unsolvable is a space is completely filled. Trickles down when scroll like the salt.  
-Random blocks: sometimes, without warning, a space will be filled in with a wood grain block, that has no letter in it. If the whole word fills with these blocks, the word solves itself but you get no points.  
  
### The solution  
Type the correct letter for the space completing the word which automatically submits the answer when all baoxes for the respective row are filled, auto-repositioning the cursor/carat to the first blank space of the next word if correct, or starting over all all blank spaces (except the first letter) on the same row.  
  
For each of the obstacle, there is a respective solve, and a power boost:  
-Ice: 3 correct answers or use of one ice pick power boost one time (which consumes one stick of that power boost)  
-Padlock: solve the word after the locked word or use one lock key power boost one time (which consumes one stock of that power boost)  
-Charcoal: solve words faster to set back the perpetually rising smoke until the smoldering word is solved which puts out the smoke or use one extinguisher power boost one time (which consumes one stock of that power boost)  
-Acid: solve words faster to end the round before all the words melt or use one base solution (chemistry flask) power boost one time that turns the acid into salt that has a secondary effect that it may fill one word space over time which you must solved faster for before the spaces are filled with salt (which consumes one stock of that power boost)  
-Flood: solve the word with a drain valve releasing the water, or use water pump power boost and the water drains (which consumes one stock of that power boost)  
-Acorn: try to solve faster or solve around the branches so it doesn’t affect the score, or use tundra power boost to weight the branches with snow that makes the words visible (which consumes one stock of that power boost)  
-Magnet: solve the next thee words consecutively, or use an electric magnet power boost to pull the magnet away (which consumes one stock of that power boost)  
-Sand: solve faster to get correct all the words effected or use a bucket of water power boost (one can be used, at max, on 3 words at once even though the number is effected words may reach up to 5. This consumes one stock of that power boost)  
-random blocks. Each correct letter in its correct place breaks the block releasing that space, or use the block power boost, represented by the red only portion of the no smoking sign (which consumes one stock of that power boost)  
  
Power boosts can also boost score if used without being put to use toward an obstacle.   
  
  
  
##Key Features:  
-Power boosts  
-Upgrades: input mode options (radial mode submission like the game, wordscapes; scrambled scrabble letter tiles)  
Hints, hearts, lives (hearts are in the level and the number of them carries over to each level until passing “boss level” or they recover over specified time, watch a rewarded ad to recover one heart at a time or penalty box for hearts— and a life is lost if all hearts are lost—lives displayed in the world map area. Hints operate like lives accept they replenish on each level, and when it is lives, can watch a rewarded ad to recover one extra hint, or penalty box for hints. Lives work the same as hearts. When they’re gone, there’s a rewarded ad, then the penalty box after.)  
Store: to buy power packs, upgrades, character skins (for avatar characters that walk the world map and interact in gameplay), merch (coming soon).  
Stars: earned in gameplay for completing a challenge set at the beginning of the level (time based, power boost usage based).  
Diamonds: (player discovers them for the first time with stellar gameplay—tutorial only triggers after discovery), can be bought in the store in large quantities, used for premium power packs, upgrades, skins and merch, or earned through the game in lesser quantities, or world map integrated promo challenges, as well as share, where you share/invite and the person(s) you share to get to a certain level ( to insure they have seen some ads), then you get a number of diamonds.  
Inventory to choose from to take into gameplay, and switch out in between.  
  
  
##Other features:  
  
-Login streaks and gifts of boosts and/or random lower tier premium packs  
-Surge bar in gameplay to view real time momentum  
-“Vs mode” for player to play against each other. The rules vary slightly. It’s a turn-based version where there is an endless (or very long) column of words in the display window to be solved, and each player has their own time clock in which to continue solving the pixel back and forth until one of them runs out of time. The power boost there is the ability to skip turn, winning then an advantage in time.  
-And a shareable aspect that gives insight into the player as a person, based on gameplay habits, they can share on socials.  
A progressive narrative that is revealed through level environment design and evidential story telling, scripts for npcs on the map, the word pool pulled from lining the word choices to the circumstances of the story and the environment, and cut scenes.  
-Ads will be interstitial and rewarded. I would like to attach ad networks like admob, as well as place my own ads within the game with a targeted option so that I can narrow down zip codes for certain ads, or not narrow at all.  
In-game tutorials are there as well when something is new.  
  
##What makes it different:  
It takes different approaches to immerse the player into the game, from the merging of different puzzle game formats—candy crush, wordscapes, word villas (for the world map), and even an RPG (where abilities through power boosts and upgrades grow) in the story. I call it the word puzzle game with a rush.
