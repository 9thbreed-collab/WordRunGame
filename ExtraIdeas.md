Here are some extra Ideas that I would like to implement. 
I'm just compiling them here to use later (in no particular order).

## Skins and Plushies
- Some skins are earned, some skins are bought, some are both.
- All Skins will come along with a single plushie print license 
  ("Plushie Print license" my own phrasing-- we can find the correct terminology later.)
- Most Plushies will be sold through registered vendors 
  (people/vendors my company gives express permission for 
  selling these products as official partners/vendors) or the site/game store
- vendors will have a vendor number and have to be found on the vendor registry for
  customers to verify authenticity
- The plushies sold in the game come with an optional custom engraving
- premium plushies have to be earned first (partnering IP etc.). 
  (you get to a certain level to unlock the opportunity to buy it)
  then you make a purchase for the license (both skin and plushie at once)
- premium plushies are not sold in stores, online, with vendors or partners.
  which means you have to play the game AND pay the fee to get the skin and plushie.
